# Kitchen-and-Bathroom-Remodel

## Overview
### Description
This is a simple web application created for a friend to be able to show his previous projects to new customers. It allows users to view his past projects, to contact him by filling out a form with all their information, and a section for him to describe his buisness. His information is also located at the bottom of the page if they rather contact him directly. To create the frontend I used ReactJS and for the backend python and Django were used.
